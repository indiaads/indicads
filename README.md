## Indian ads

To classify the images in a directory, set the ```model :``` in ```config.yaml``` to ```vit``` or ```convnext```` to use one of them as feature extractor, and then run ```classify.py``` by giving the arguments as following.

```
classify.py --dataset <path of dir with images> --ckpt_path <path of the ckpt file> --pred_out <predictions_file.pkl>
```
> NOTE: give a file name along with the .pkl or .pickle extension for --pred_out

Running the above script generate a .pkl file, which contains all filenames of the images, and the class label predicted. 1 for ads, and 0 for non-ads.
